# Trek

## About This Project

Have you ever tried to plan a group trip with your friends, but it never "made it out of the group chat"? Then this web app is perfect for you! Trek provides a centralized place do to all of your trip planning - say goodbye to Google Docs! Once you log in, Trek allows you to design your ideal trip, with trip destinations, timeframes, accomodations, and more. Then save the trip and let Trek easily let you share your trips with a single click. Trek can intelligently recommend the best things to do by using API calls to sites like Tripadvisor to get up-to-date ratings on good places to visit, as well as through other Trek users' most popular destinations. Trek can also display everything on an interactive map to help you visualize your transportation planning! Trek might also be able to give your groups weather information, a full iternary written up by an LLM, and even specific transportation options with their costs.
