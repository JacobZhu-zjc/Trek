## About Trek (150-200 words)

Have you ever tried to plan a group trip with your friends, but it never "made it out of the group chat"? Then this web app is perfect for you! Trek provides a centralized place do to all of your trip planning - say goodbye to Google Docs! Simply log in, start creating trips, and share with a single click. Trek can intelligently recommend the best things to do as well as display everything on an interactive map to aid with transportation planning.
