## About Trek (150-200 words)

Have you ever tried to plan a group trip with your friends, but it never "made it out of the group chat"? Then this web app is perfect for you! Trek provides a centralized place do to all of your trip planning - say goodbye to Google Docs! Simply log in, start creating trips, and share with a single click. Trek can intelligently recommend the best things to do as well as display everything on an interactive map to aid with transportation planning.

### Task Requirements
#### Minimal
- User account creation
- User profile information (CRUD operations?)
- List of trips associated with user (shared, created by me)
- Save/Load/Edit trip data
#### Standard
- Collaboration (link sharing, invite codes)
- Aggregating Trip information with APIs
- Search for locations within cities, add location pins on map? (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search)
- Map (Google maps API?) 
#### Stretch
- AI/ML recommendations? (could also do pre-stored entries)
- Show city/town specific transportation options/cost
- Weather information
- Generate itinerary for trips using LLM wrapper
